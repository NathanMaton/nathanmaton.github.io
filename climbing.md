title: My climbing
---

I started climbing in middle school with my buddy <a href='https://sportrock.com/leadership/'>
Sean</a>. We eventually skipped 2 weeks in our senior year, flew to California, hitchhiked to Yosemite 
and had a blast. He kept climbing ever since and now runs a gym in the DC metro area.

I've been in and out of it over the years. Climbing has taken me to Thailand, up some tall things in Red Rocks 
(1000 feet or so), and many smaller things. The last 1-2 years I've focused on bouldering.
This is fun because I record the successful attempts to help others working on the same project. 

Here are a few highlights:

title: Misu Mood Prediction

## Context

Misu is a desktop app that helps automatically track your mood by taking screenshots of you every 30 seconds. It
puts privacy first so the screenshots aren't recorded and you can adjust it to make sure you feel comfortable.
It evolved out of Stigma, an app that allowed people to manually track their mood, realizing that part
had too much friction.

## Project

I got involved to research if it was possible to predict people's future Misu mood score using machine learning.
I led a project trying various modeling approaches and we ultimately discovered for people who have consistently used Misu
for a week we could predict their mood scores fairly accurately and then help guide them in other directions.

Below is an example of predictions for a Misu user vs. their actual mood score.

## Key Takeaways

* While mood seems ephemeral and hard to predict, trends in one's mood do have
discernable patterns even if they're not completely predictable.
* There is a trend and hunger in certain audiences for tools like Misu that 
I expect to grow in the coming decade.

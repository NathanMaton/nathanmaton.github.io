## Context

I'm very curious and love asking questions. As I thought about how to 
use those strengths I realized podcasting could be a great fit. My show ReSync
highlights how one's personal growth could lead to large societal impact.
Guests all had a period where they summoned the courage to face inner challenges
and leveraged that to shift or amplify their careers.

## Project

One episode of the show focuses on Amita Swadhin, an influential activist dedicated to fighting interpersonal 
and institutional violence against young people. They struggled to stay involved
with anti-violence work due to trauma from child sexual abuse. In graduate school,
they were able to heal and return to this work and in the decade since  was the Los Angeles Executive Director of Peer Health Exchange
and much more. 

## Takeaways

* Times of transition lead to growth if you take risks and grow by being vulnerable.
* Podcasts are a great way to connect with people around the world and can grow
very specific niche communities. 
* Editing is hard. I would love to make this show with more funding to hire an incredible 
editor. That wasn't one of my strengths.

![Amita episode](/images/amita.png)

I produced, edited and distributed a 10-episode podcast highlighting how one's personal
growth could lead to large societal impact. Guests all had a period where they 
summoned the courage to face inner challenges and leveraged that to shift or amplify their 
careers.
 
Amita Swadhin is an influential activist dedicated to fighting interpersonal 
and institutional violence against young people. They struggled to stay involved
with anti-violence work due to trauma from child sexual abuse. In graduate school,
they were able to heal and return to this work and in the decade since  was the Los Angeles Executive Director of Peer Health Exchange
and much more. Bryan Ungard, profiled in [An Everyone Culture: Becoming a Deliberately Developmental Organization](https://www.audible.com/pd/An-Everyone-Culture-Audiobook/B01N9V51BW),
helped Decurion shift into an organization that uses people's growth to drive business results.

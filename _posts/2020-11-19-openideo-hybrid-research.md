## Context 

[OpenIDEO](https://www.openideo.com/) puts the power of human-centered design in the hands of many through a 
crowdsourced innovation platform. It runs challenges in partnership with organizations
to spur collaboration and innovation. 

## Project

As a Community Designer and then Product Manager
there, I co-led a mixed methods research study to help us better understand it's impact with [Juliette Melton](https://www.juliettemelton.com/).
She led the qualitative research and I led the quantitative analysis. We didn't
have any mandate for this project but both felt it would be impactful and
followed our intuition to make it happen in a scrappy way without needing
any extra resources.

We discovered two impactful insights. First, we found four personas and one that 
helped the others feel useful. The group that preferred "I take what I learn from OpenIDEO to make positive changes in my local community" 
includes people who are more active in their communities than the others. This persona,
the action-oriented type, drove satisfaction for the other personas, the designer, 
those who wanted to amplify other's work through communication, and the subject
matter experts. We knew that activating this action-oriented group could help grow
OpenIDEO.

The other big insight was about the offline actions taking place. 
One story we kept hearing was how people are working on OpenIDEO challenges 
in their communities, with friends and through social networks. 
We wanted to understand the ways that they are engaging with OpenIDEO 
that we aren't able to measure through traditional website metrics, 
since they are happening off-platform. As we continued our research 
project through a survey, 
we made sure to ask about this kind of engagement and learned that 
it's widespread. Of the survey respondents, 
80% have done some kind of off-platform engagement. 
Some examples were: student projects, grant applications and meetups. This
discovery led to a large investment I led in building a offline 
events capacity we call Meetups.

## Takeaways

* If you can build a bridge to someone with complimentary skills, you're able to make a big impact.
* Mixing qualitative and quantitative data together can lead to important discoveries 
to shape your product.

Sleep and Emotional Regulation

I volunteered for 3 months with the Stanford Psychophysiology Lab as a Research 
Assistant to help them run an experiment that is part of their [The Stanford Home Sleep Study](https://homesleep.stanford.edu/about-study)
looking to understand the relationships between sleep and emotional regulation. I built 
experiments in PsychoPy and made sure they connected to the breath sensors,
heart rate monitors, and facial movement detection sensors. 

In our experiment we showed participants images of various levels of valence and arousal 
to get baseline levels. We also briefly taught them simple emotional regulation theories
around re-framing and distracting yourself depending on the level of emotion. This is part 
of an ongoing 5-year study that will shed light on emotional regulation and sleep.

## Context  

I volunteered for 3 months with the Stanford Psychophysiology Lab as a Research 
Assistant to help run an experiment that is part of their [The Stanford Home Sleep Study](https://homesleep.stanford.edu/about-study)
looking to understand the relationships between sleep and emotional regulation. 

## Project


In our experiment we showed participants images of various levels of valence and arousal 
to get baseline levels. We also briefly taught them simple emotional regulation theories
around re-framing and distracting yourself depending on the level of emotion. This is part 
of an ongoing 5-year study that will shed light on emotional regulation and sleep.

I built experiments in PsychoPy and made sure they connected to the breath sensors,
heart rate monitors, and facial movement detection sensors.

## Takeaways

* This was a great experience learning about hardware and sensor data as well 
as protocols to test affect like quickly changing images.
* There are major opportunities for making it easier to integrate
hardware and software together given the desire of researchers and the current 
level of effort it takes to run these projects.

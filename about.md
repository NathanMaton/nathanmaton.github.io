## A Turning Point

After leaving multiple jobs at prestigious companies I came to realize the jobs weren’t the issue, but instead something inside of me. I noticed I would do almost anything to avoid certain feelings like anger or fear, and that I silenced myself and looked for greener pastures. 

This awareness came as I got deeper into meditation, where I noticed how unaware I was much of the time, especially when it came to my emotions. I practiced being in the present more and observed my anxiety dramatically decrease. With awareness, I developed the ability to stick through a feeling and make a better decision instead of letting my fear drive my actions. 

This growth led me to study emotions. I learned theories of emotional regulation, volunteering at the research labs of Dr. Dacher Keltner and Dr. James Gross at Berkeley and Stanford respectively. 

## Coaching

I now coach to help others to learn about accepting and using all of their emotions, not just their favorite ones. There are incredible people out there doing incredible things who haven’t yet seen how much more powerful they can be when they show up with their whole self.

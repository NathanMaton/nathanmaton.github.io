<h4>My story:</h4>

I started as a community organizer, went into education leading large programs until I started struggling. I saw my own
internal barriers as the biggest obstacles to my growth and through a variety of trainings and mindfulness building
grew. I now coach and consult to help individuals and organizations flourish.

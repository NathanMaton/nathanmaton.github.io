Hello! I'm Nathan. Welcome to my internet home.

<br><br>
You can find out about my background, coaching, and hobbies here. The short summary is that I'm a person
who believes people's growth is the key to building successful businesses. I started as a community organizer
and went on to lead large products and programs that had a community focus at Google, Khan Academy, IDEO.

<br><br>
As my career took off, I saw my growth as the biggest blocker to my success. I didn't want to keep succeeding
in a way that left me depleted. So I got into meditation and inner growth and now am passionate about developing great leaders.
Check out my <a href="/coaching">coaching</a> services or learn more <a href="/about">about</a> me. Thanks!
